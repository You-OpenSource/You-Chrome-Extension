# You-Chrome-Extension

This Chrome extension sets [you.com](https://you.com/) as your default search engine. Because we believe that users deserve control over their search experience, it also allows you to switch your default search engine between [You.com](https://you.com/), [YouCode](https://code.you.com/) (search engine designed for developers), Google and DuckDuckGo with one click.

**Use Extension:**
Download extension in the Chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youcom-multi-engine-searc/fhplnehgjpmohhldfnjhibanpbiedofi
